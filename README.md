Algorithms for identifying local associations in biological time series
===

### INTRODUCTION

This software package stores the code for generating benchmark datasets and the usage methods of five software for calculating biological time series correlations. Contains the following two folders.

Codes--Contains five software usage methods `Tutorials for using five software tools. md` and Lotka Volterra dataset generation code `lotka Volterra. ipynb`. The generation code for the dataset comes from Weiss et al.(Correlation detection strategies in microbial data sets vary widely in sensitivity and precision，2016), and if readers want to learn about the generation of other model datasets, they can click [here](ftp.microbio.me/pub/cooccurrence_files.zip) to obtain it.

Tables S1-S10--The input data of five software tools was obtained by deleting a sequence with zero values exceeding 80% from the table set 2.6-2.15 generated by `lotka-volterra.ipynb`, resulting in Tables S1-S10.

### USAGE

1. Generate benchmark datasets Tables Set 2.6-2.15 using `lotka-volterra.ipynb`;
2. We pre-processed the benchmark datasets and filtered out sequences with more than 80% of zero values in one sequence,resulting in Tables S1-S10；
3. Use `Tutorials for using five software tools.md` to input Tables S1-S10 into five software tools to obtain the output results and runtime.
